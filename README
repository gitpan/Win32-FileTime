NAME
    Win32::FileTime - Perl module for accessing Win32 file times

SYNOPSIS
     use Win32::FileTime;

     my $filename = "foo.txt";
     my $filetime = Win32::FileTime->new( $filename );

     printf( 
         "Accessed : %4d/%02d/%02d %02d:%02d:%02d",
         $filetime->Access( 
             'year', 
             'month', 
             'day', 
             'hour', 
             'minute', 
             'second' 
         )
     );

DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for
    obtaining creation, access and modification times for files on Win32
    systems.

METHODS
    The following methods are available through this module for use with
    Win32::FileTime objects. No methods can be exported into the calling
    namespace.

    new
         my $filetime = Win32::FileTime->new( $filename );

        This object constructor creates and returns a new Win32::FileTime
        object. The only mandatory argument to this object constructor is a
        relative or absolute file path. It is the creation, access and
        modification times of this file which are obtained and returned by
        this Win32::FileTime object.

    Access( @arguments )
         my @AccessTime = $filetime->Access( @arguments );

        This method returns an array corresponding to the last access time
        of the file specified in the object constructor.

    Create( @arguments )
         my @CreateTime = $filetime->Create( @arguments );

        This method returns an array corresponding to the creation time of
        the file specified in the object constructor.

    Modify( @arguments )
         my @ModifyTime = $filetime->Modify( @arguments );

        This method returns an array corresponding to the modification time
        of the file specified in the object constructor.

    The arguments to these methods can be any combination of the following
    list of time field arguments - "year", "month", "wday", "day", "hour",
    "minute", "second" and "msecond". The passing of any of these time field
    arguments to Win32::FileTime methods returns the respective time field
    in the order passed to the object method.

    If no arguments are specified, the entire array of time fields is
    returned in the order defined above.
